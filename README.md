# Repository Structure

This portfolio is going to be organized into the folders based on their category. For example:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   This folder will contain projects focused on understanding data, identifying trends, and uncovering insights.

   ---

2. **Visualizations**  
   Will contain data visualizations and dashboards created using tools like Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

   ---

3. **Models**  
   Will include work related to machine learning models, feature engineering experiments, and model evaluations.

   ---

4. **Notebooks**
     
   Jupyter notebooks that showcase step-by-step processes for solving specific data problems.

   ---

5. **Weekly In-Class Coding Work**  
   A collection of notebooks showcasing various topics I've learned and applied in class, with demonstrated mastery through the completed projects.

6. **Tidy Data Project**
      [[Link to Tidy Data Repository](https://github.com/jmikovits/Mikovits-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/TidyData-Project/TidyData_Project.ipynb)]
   #### Overview
   In this project, I focused on the concept of **tidy data**, a core technique in data science that enhances the organization and analysis of datasets. I applied the principles of **tidy data** as outlined by Hadley Wickham to clean and restructure a messy dataset. By     utilizing **Python** and **Pandas**, I performed key data wrangling tasks such as:
   - Handling missing values
   - Standardizing column names
   - Reshaping and organizing the dataset into a format suitable for analysis
   #### Project Significance
   This project serves as an important component of my portfolio, showcasing my proficiency in data cleaning and preparation techniques. The ability to transform raw data into a structured, analyzable format is a critical skill for data science roles,                 particularly in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflows. The use of **Python** and **Pandas** highlights my capability with industry-standard tools that are integral to data science practices.
   The Tidy Data project demonstrates my functional expertise in working with data and data cleaning, complementing other portfolio projects that involve data analysis and visualization. It underscores my commitment to building a solid foundation in data science 
   through practical, real-world applications of data preparation and structuring techniques.
