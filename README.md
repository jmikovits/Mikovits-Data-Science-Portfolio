# Repository Structure

This portfolio is going to be organized into the folders based on their category. For example:

1. **Weekly In-Class Coding Work** [[Link to Folder](https://github.com/jmikovits/Mikovits-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/In-Class%20Coding%20Work)]  
   A collection of notebooks showcasing various topics I've learned and applied in my Data Science class, with demonstrated mastery through the completed projects. The projects discussed below demonstrate my mastery and application of the course material to different datasets.

2. **Basic Streamlit App** [[Link to Basic Streamlit App Repository](https://github.com/jmikovits/Mikovits-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)]
     #### Overview
     In this project, I created a basic Streamlit app that performs some **Exploratory Data Analysis** on the Palmer's Penguins dataset. The app allows users to filter and visualize data about different penguin species, providing insights into their characteristics like flipper length.
     #### Project Significance
     This project is meaningful because it is the starting point of my Data Science Portfolio. As seen later, I have built more complex Streamlit apps, but this app served as a foundation for creating interactive apps that others can use.

3. **Tidy Data Project**
      [[Link to Tidy Data Repository](https://github.com/jmikovits/Mikovits-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)]
   #### Overview
   In this project, I focused on the concept of **tidy data**, a core technique in data science that enhances the organization and analysis of datasets. I applied the principles of **tidy data** as outlined by Hadley Wickham to clean and restructure a messy dataset. By     utilizing **Python** and **Pandas**, I performed key data wrangling tasks such as:
   - Handling missing values
   - Standardizing column names
   - Reshaping and organizing the dataset into a format suitable for analysis
   #### Project Significance
   This project serves as an important component of my portfolio, showcasing my proficiency in data cleaning and preparation techniques. The ability to transform raw data into a structured, analyzable format is a critical skill for data science roles,                 particularly in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflows. The use of **Python** and **Pandas** highlights my capability with industry-standard tools that are integral to data science practices.
   The Tidy Data project demonstrates my functional expertise in working with data and data cleaning, complementing other portfolio projects that involve data analysis and visualization. It underscores my commitment to building a solid foundation in data science 
   through practical, real-world applications of data preparation and structuring techniques.

4. **Machine Learning Streamlit App**
     [[Link to ML-App Repository](https://github.com/jmikovits/Mikovits-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)]
   #### Overview
   In this project, I created a Streamlit App that allows users to upload a dataset of their choice and experiment with different machine learning techniques. The machine learning techniques included in this app are **Linear Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Decision Trees**. By using **Matplotlib, Pandas, Streamlit, scikit-learn, Numpy, and Seaborn**, this app allows you to:
   - Upload a dataset, then view and filter data within the dataset.
   - Apply Machine Learning techniques such as **Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees** to the dataset.
   - Compare model accuracy on scaled vs. unscaled data.
   - View performance feedback such as R^2, Mean Squared Error, accuracy, precision, ROC curve, or AUC score.
   - Add your feedback so I can improve this app in the future!
   #### Project Significance
   This project is important because machine learning techniques are central to modern data science workflows. By building an interactive Python Streamlit app, I implemented core ML algorithms, but also created an accessible tool that allows others to explore and experiment with these models using their own datasets. This project highlights my ability to combine technical knowledge with user-focused design. It strengthens my portfolio by demonstrating skills in data preprocessing, model evaluation, interactive visualizations, and full-stack deployment.

5. **Unsupervised Machine Learning Streamlit App**
     [[Link to ML-Unsupervised-App Repository](https://github.com/jmikovits/Mikovits-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)]
   #### Overview
   In this project, I developed an interactive Streamlit application that enables users to explore unsupervised machine learning using either the built-in Palmerâ€™s Penguins dataset or their own uploaded data. The app features three key techniques: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA), KMeans Clustering, and Hierarchical Clustering**. Built with **Streamlit, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SciPy**, the app offers an intuitive interface where users can:
   - Use the Palmer's penguins dataset or upload a dataset, then view and filter data within the dataset.
   - Apply Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **KMeans Clustering**, and **Hierarchical Clustering** to the dataset.
   - Compare model outputs and accuracy on scaled vs. unscaled data.
   - View performance feedback such as elbow plots, dendrogram, scatterplots, and silhouette scores.
   - Add your feedback so I can improve this app in the future!
   #### Project Significance
   This project explores unsupervised machine learning through an interactive Streamlit app featuring **PCA**, **KMeans**, and **Hierarchical Clustering**. It allows users to upload datasets, tune parameters, and visualize model results in real time. The app highlights my ability to combine machine learning with thoughtful UI design, making complex techniques both functional and intuitive. By making these techniques approachable and hands-on, the app serves as both an educational tool and a demonstration of end-to-end data science capability.
