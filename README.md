# Repository Structure

This portfolio is going to be organized into the folders based on their category. For example:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   This folder will contain projects focused on understanding data, identifying trends, and uncovering insights.

   ---

2. **Visualizations**  
   Will contain data visualizations and dashboards created using tools like Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

   ---

3. **Models**  
   Will include work related to machine learning models, feature engineering experiments, and model evaluations.

   ---

4. **Notebooks**
     
   Jupyter notebooks that showcase step-by-step processes for solving specific data problems.

   ---

5. **Weekly In-Class Coding Work**  
   A collection of notebooks showcasing various topics I've learned and applied in class, with demonstrated mastery through the completed projects.

    Project Description:
    This project focuses on the concept of tidy data, a foundational principle in data science for structuring datasets to optimize analysis and manipulation. In this project, I applied the principles outlined by Hadley Wickham to transform a messy dataset into a tidy       format. Using Python and Pandas, I performed essential data cleaning tasks, including:
     - **Handling missing values** 
     - **Standardizing column names** 
     - **Reshaping and organizing the dataset into a format suitable for analysis**
    This project highlights my expertise in data cleaning, a critical skill for any data science role. By transforming raw data into a structured and analyzable format, I demonstrated my ability to prepare datasets for further analysis, visualization, and machine            learning applications. Additionally, my use of Python and Pandas illustrates my proficiency with key tools widely utilized in the data science field.
